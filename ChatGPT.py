Hello Hamsha,

I wanted to highlight two things:

We're currently not documenting our methodology anywhere. Could we start using Confluence for this? It would be helpful for our knowledge transfer (KT) sessions.

Can we conduct a few sessions on key concepts in software engineering and AI engineeringâ€”such as Pydantic, unit testing, mocking and patching, and parallel processing? Suraj and I can split the topics and lead these sessions.
